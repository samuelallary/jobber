    <summary><b>FAQ</b></summary>
    <details>
    <summary>why RSS?</summary>
    it's a boring, old, minimalistic technology that does the job
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>do I really have to install an app?</summary>
    no! you can use a browser extension (see reader recommendations)
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>which job portals does it use?</summary>
    currently only LinkedIn. you don't need a LinkedIn account to use this service
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>why does my job search doesn't show a week of content?</summary>
    services like LinkedIn limit the amount of information that can be retrieved. If you do a search that will most likely return more than 1000 items, only 990 items will be shown. be careful with generalistic searches like "developer + remote"

    hourly
    </details>
